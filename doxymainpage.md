\section introduction Overview
Operation Null Mind is a 2D top-down shooter with roguelike elements, developed in C utilizing the SDL2 framework. This comprehensive documentation aims to provide developers with a detailed understanding of the codebase architecture, including:

- Application execution flow and lifecycle
- Project structural organization
- Critical global variables and state management
- Core algorithms, data structures, and implementation details

This documentation is designed to facilitate efficient navigation and comprehension of the codebase for both new and experienced contributors to the project.

\section navigation Navigating This Documentation
This documentation is generated using Doxygen and offers several navigation methods:

- **Navigation Tabs**: At the top of each page, tabs provide access to different sections:
  - *Classes*: View all the structs throughout the codebase
  - *Files*: Browse the project file hierarchy and examine individual source files
  - *Namespaces*: Explore logically grouped components (if applicable)
  - *Modules*: Access functionally organized sections of the codebase

- **Search Function**: Use the search box in the upper right corner to find specific elements

- **Class Hierarchy**: Review inheritance relationships through the class hierarchy diagrams

- **File Dependency Graphs**: Understand file relationships via dependency visualizations

- **Cross-References**: Click on highlighted identifiers to navigate directly to their definitions

- **Breadcrumbs**: Use the breadcrumb trail at the bottom    of each page to track your location

For optimal navigation, begin with either the structural overview provided on this main page or use the search functionality if looking for specific components.
