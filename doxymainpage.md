[TOC]

## Overview {#introduction}
Operation Null Mind is a 2D top-down shooter with roguelike elements, developed in C utilizing the SDL2 framework. This comprehensive documentation aims to provide developers with a detailed understanding of the codebase architecture, including:

- Application execution flow and lifecycle
- Project structural organization
- Critical global variables and state management
- Core algorithms, data structures, and implementation details

This documentation is designed to facilitate efficient navigation and comprehension of the codebase for both new and experienced contributors to the project.

## Navigating This Documentation {#navigation}
This documentation is generated using Doxygen and offers several navigation methods:

- **Navigation Tabs**: At the top of each page, tabs provide access to different sections:
  - *Classes*: View all the structs throughout the codebase
  - *Files*: Browse the project file hierarchy and examine individual source files

- **Search Function**: Use the search box in the upper right corner to find specific elements

**Note**: The "All" search option in Doxygen is not really good. You may have
